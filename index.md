# favorite CPSC 120L labs 
Lab 1
One of the labs that I want to say that 1 was one of the ones that I found to be very interesting and also somewhat fun is Lab 1. I chose this particular lab because it was the very first lab where we had the opportunity to get into coding, see how it works, and it was the first step for us to begin coding. This lab was also the first time I spoke to my friend that I have now and it made it connect and depend on each other so that we can both complete the lab and make sure it is going well. 

Lab 6 Part 1
So this lab we had worked on the sandwich and the card game but my favorite part was part 1. I said i liked part one because we went over the functions && and ||. This part of the lab made me and my partner really think about when and where those functions are supposed to go into the code. Although it was difficult, we were able to do this part with both of each other's help to finish. We got through most of the second part during the lab day but it was more difficult than the first part because i believe we had to integrate most of the && and ||. Nevertheless, the lab was pretty good. 

Lab 11
This was not the best one for me personally because it was really tough and had the class struggling. The code that we had to do was very difficult but we did get some help from the TAâ€™s to get us through it. When we saw the TA help us with the code it gave me a better understanding on what I was supposed to do not just for the lab itself but for future labs as well. Overall the lab was more difficult than the other labs and me and my partner needed more help.
